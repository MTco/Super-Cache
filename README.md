Super-Cache
The Purpose of the application is to be able to cache static content of websites. Instead of changing the server side settings for caching this chrome-extension will allow you to cache the static content from the client side itself.

User can control what to cache in the following ways-

He can control the host on which he wants the caching to be enabled. Once the host is selected all the requests coming from that host will selected for caching.
User can control specifically the things that he wants to be cached such as web pages, stylesheets, scripts and images.
User can control caching for content that already have some caching behavior by overriding it.
